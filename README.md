# Arduino Light Up Skull

![arduino-lightup-skull](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandmooffin/Arduino-LightUp-Skull/master/arduino_lightup_skull_schematics_bb.png)

## Project Overview
* Arduino Nano
* Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
* 2 LEDs
* 4 resistors (100ohms)

This project was originally created for [HacksterMIA](https://www.meetup.com/HacksterMIA/events/265740824/)/[GDG Miami](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Miami/events/265740859/) meetup event.

## Getting Started 
- Download or clone the repo (or fork it!)

## Setting up
- Download and install Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
- Open up the sketch `arduino_skull.ino`

## Deploy sketch
- After you have the component connected, connect your Arduio Nano via USB
- Open up Arduino IDE with the sketch
- Verify the correct board is selected
    - Go to Tools and then Board and make sure you select Arduino Nano or something similar
- Verify the correct COM port is selected
    - Go to Tools and then COM and make sure you have the correct COM port selected
- Compile the sketch by clicking the checkmark button on the top left
- If the compilation is successful then flash the code! Click on the arrow button next to the compile button

## Troubleshooting
- COM port is failing to connect to device and flash but I am certain it is the correct port!
    - Verify that the connection between the computer and board are good. If you are using a USB-C adapter make sure that it has enough power going to your board.
